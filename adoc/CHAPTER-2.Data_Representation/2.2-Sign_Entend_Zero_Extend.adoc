=== *2.2 Sign Extend & Zero Extend*

[.text-justify]
In *`LoongArch`* computing instructions, immediate values require either *`Sign-Extend`* or *`Zero-Extend`*.

[.text-justify]
* 32-bit sign extend: Fills the high 32-n bits of an n-bit immediate with the highest bit of the immediate.

[.text-justify]
* 64 bit sign extend: Fills the high 64-n bits of an n-bit immediate with the highest bit of the immediate.

[.text-justify]
* 32-bit unsigned extend: Fill the high 32-n bits of the n-bit immediate with 0.

[.text-justify]
* 64 bit unsigned extend: Fill the high 64-n bits of the n-bit immediate with 0.

[.text-justify]
In the subsequent instructions, `*Sign*`*Extend*(x, len) represents sign extension, where x is the object to be extended and len is the desired final length of x after the sign extension. ZeroExtend(x, len) extends x to len by filling the additional bits with 0.

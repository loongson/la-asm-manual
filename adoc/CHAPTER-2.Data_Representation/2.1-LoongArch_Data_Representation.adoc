=== *2.1 `LoongArch` Data Representation*

[.text-justify]
There are five data types for basic integer instruction operations, namely:

[.text-justify]
* *`bit`* (short for 1 bit)

[.text-justify]
* *`byte`* (short for *`B`*, length 8 bits)

[.text-justify]
* *`halfword`* (short for *`H`*, length 16 bits)

[.text-justify]
* *`word`* (short for *`W`*, length 32 bits)

[.text-justify]
* *`doubleword`* (short for *`D`*, length 64 bits)

[.text-justify]
Under the *`LA32`* architecture, there are no integer instructions for manipulating doublewords. Byte, half word, and word data types are encoded using binary complement.

[.text-justify]
Floating-point data types include single precision floating-point numbers and double precision floating-point numbers, both of which follow the definition in the *`IEEE 754-2008 standard`* specification.

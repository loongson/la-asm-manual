^.^|*`dbar`*
^.^|*`hint`*
|===========================

*Description :*

The *`DBAR`* instruction is used to complete the barrier function between *`load`*/*`store`* memory access operations. The immediate *`hint`* it carries is used to indicate the synchronization object and synchronization degree of the barrier.

A *`hint`* value of *`0`* is mandatory by default, and it indicates a fully functional synchronization barrier. Only after all previous *`load`*/*`store`* access operations are completely executed, the *`DBAR 0`* instruction can be executed; and only after the execution of *`DBAR 0`* is completed, all subsequent *`load`*/*`store`* access operations can be executed.

If there is no special function implementation, all other *`hint`* values must be executed according to *`hint`*=*`0`*.

^.^|*`ibar`*
^.^|*`hint`*
|===========================

*Description :*

The *`IBAR`* instruction is used to complete the synchronization between the *`store`* operation and the instruction fetch operation within a single processor core. The immediate *`hint`* it carries is used to indicate the synchronization object and synchronization degree of the barrier.

A *`hint`* value of *`0`* is mandatory by default. It can ensure that the instruction fetch after the *`IBAR 0`* instruction must be able to observe the execution effect of all *`store`* operations before the *`IBAR 0`* instruction.

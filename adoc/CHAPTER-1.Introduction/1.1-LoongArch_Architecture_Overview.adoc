=== *1.1 `LoongArch` Architecture Overview*

[.text-justify]
*`LoongArch`* has the typical characteristics of RISC. Its instructions are of fixed size and follow regular formats. Most instructions use two source operands and one destination operand. *`LoongArch`* is a load-store architecture, meaning that only load and store instructions can access memory; the operands of other instructions reside within the processor core or are immediate values specified in the instruction opcode.

*`LoongArch`* is divided into two versions: the 32-bit version (*`LA32`*) and the 64-bit version (*`LA64`*). *`LA64`* applications provide “application-level backward binary compatibility” with *`LA32`* applications, meaning that *`LA32`* applications can run directly on a machine compatible with *`LA64`*. However, the behavior of system software, such as the kernel, on a machine compatible with LA32 is not guaranteed to be the same as on a machine compatible with LA64.

*`LoongArch`* is composed of a basic part (*`Loongson Base`*) and an expanded part, as shown in the figure. The expansion part includes Loongson Binary Translation (*`LBT`*), Loongson Virtualization (*`LVZ`*), Loongson SIMD Extension (*`LSX`*), and Loongson Advanced SIMD Extension(*`LASX`*).

=== *1.1 `LoongArch` Architecture Overview*

[.text-justify]
*`LoongArch`* has the typical characteristics of RISC. *`LoongArch`* instructions are of fixed size and have regular instruction formats. Most of the instructions have two source operands and one destination operand. *`LoongArch`* is a load-store architecture; this means only the load/store instructions can access memory the operands of the other instructions are within the processor core or the immediate number in the instruction opcode.

[.text-justify]
*`LoongArch`* is divided into two versions, the 32-bit version (*`LA32`*) and the 64-bit version (*`LA64`*). *`LA64`* applications are “application-level backward binary compatibility” with *`LA32`* applications. That means *`LA32`* applications can run directly on the machine compatible with *`LA64`*, but the behavior of system softwares (such as the kernel) on the machine compatible with *`LA32`* is not guaranteed to be the same as on the machine compatible with *`LA64`*.

[.text-justify]
*`LoongArch`* is composed of a basic part (*`Loongson Base`*) and an expanded part, as shown in the figure. The expansion part includes Loongson Binary Translation (*`LBT`*), Loongson VirtualiZation (*`LVZ`*), Loongson SIMD EXtension (*`LSX`*), and Loongson Advanced SIMD EXtension(*`LASX`*).

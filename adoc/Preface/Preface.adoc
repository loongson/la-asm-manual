== *Preface*

[.text-justify]
This preface introduces the *`LoongArch`* Assembly Language Programming Guide.

[.text-justify]
This document aims to provide guidance for assembly programmers targeting the standard *`LoongArch`* assembly language, which is supported by common open-source assemblers such as *`GNU`* as and *`LLVM`*'s assembler. Other assemblers may not support the same directives or pseudo instructions; and their dialects are beyond the scope of this document.

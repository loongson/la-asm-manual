== *Preface*

[.text-justify]
This preface introduces the *`LoongArch`* Assembly Language Programming Guide. 

This document aims to provide guidance to assembly programmers targeting the standard *`LoongArch`* assembly language, which common open-source assemblers like *`GNU`* as and *`LLVM`*'s assembler support. Other assemblers might not support the same directives or pseudo instructions; their dialects are outside the scope of this document.

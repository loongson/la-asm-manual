=== *4.1 Address Range*

[.text-justify]
The memory address space on *`LoongArch`* is a continuous linear address space that is addressed in bytes.

[.text-justify]
In *`LA32`*, the specification for the accessible memory address space for applications is: 0-2^*`31`*^-1.

[.text-justify]
In *`LA64`*, the range of memory address space accessible by application is: 0-2^*`VALEN-1`*^-1, where *`VALEN`* is generally in the range of [*`40`*,*`48`*]. Applications can determine the specific value of *`VALEN`* by executing the *`CPUCFG`* instruction to read the *`VALEN`* field of the 0x1 configuration word.

[.text-justify]
When the virtual address of the instruction fetch or memory access instruction in the application exceeds the above range, ADEF or ADEM will be triggered.

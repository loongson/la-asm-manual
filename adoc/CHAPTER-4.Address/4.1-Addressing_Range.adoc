=== *4.1 Address Range*

[.text-justify]
The memory address space on *`LoongArch`* is a continuous linear address space, which is addressed in bytes.

[.text-justify]
In *`LA32`*, the specification of the memory address space that application can access is: 0-2^*`31`*^-1.

[.text-justify]
In *`LA64`*, the range of memory address space accessible by application is: 0-2^*`VALEN-1`*^-1. Generally *`VALEN`* is in the range of [*`40`*,*`48`*]. Application can determine the specific value of *`VALEN`* by executing the *`CPUCFG`* instruction to read the *`VALEN`* field of the 0x1 configuration word.

When the virtual address of the instruction fetch or memory access instruction in the application exceeds the above range, ADEF or ADEM will be triggered.
